# AIML-ChatBot-for-DBMS-with-UI
Technologies used: Flask for hosting, Html, Css, Javascript for interface response and aiml model
I have successfully developed an intelligent chatbot designed to assist users with queries related to Database Management Systems (DBMS). This chatbot is powered by a Flask backend, which manages the logic and interaction between the user and the database. The user interface is crafted using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to handle dynamic responses and enhance the user experience.

The entire project is hosted as a cohesive application, ensuring that users can seamlessly interact with the chatbot through an intuitive and responsive interface. The combination of Flask's flexibility and the robust front-end technologies ensures that the chatbot not only provides accurate information but also delivers it in a user-friendly manner. This project demonstrates the integration of modern web development practices with practical database management solutions."

This version provides a thorough explanation of the project's components and the technologies involved.
